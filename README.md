# Artificial Neural Network from A to Z
An Artificial Neural Network built using Keras containing steps from Data Preprocessing to Evaluating, Improving and Tuning the model. This is a pretty straightforward demonstration of an Artificial Neural Network, have made modifications according to the latest syntax without any deprecation warnings, as of date. This program will serve as a good starting point for anyone who's looking to build an ANN from scratch. 

# Prerequisites
* Anaconda Distribution with Keras installed. If not, run the following command to install the latest Keras distribution
```conda intall -c conda-forge keras```
* Spyder IDE (comes with Anaconda)

# Instructions
1. Set appropriate working directory.
2. Open the (.py) file in Spyder IDE.
3. Run (only) relevant sections.

# Model Structure
* Part 1 - Data Preprocessing (including Encoding Categorical Data, Dataset Splitting and Feature Scaling)
* Part 2 - Building ANN (with optional Dropout Regularization)
* Part 3 - Making Predictions (including Confusion Matrix)
* Part 4 - Evaluating, Improving and Tuning (using Grid Search)

# Major Changes
* Using ```ColumnTransformer``` in place of simple ```OneHotEncoder```
* Using updated ```KerasClassifier```
